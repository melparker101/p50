### Paper

### Code
[AltasEndometriosis](https://github.com/lawrenson-lab/AtlasEndometriosis)

### Cell Types
- Mesenchymal cells
- Myeloid cells 
- Smooth muscle cells
- B lymphocytes/Plasma cells
- T cells/natural killer T cells
- Epithelial cells
- Endothelial cells

### Data Format and Access

- Download **aux.seurat.shared.rsd**, deposited at [Cedars Sinai](https://cedars.app.box.com/s/1ks3eyzlpnjbrseefw3j4k7nx6p2ut02) with accession NG-A57869R2 (this is processed).
- This was done manually on windows and then transferred across to the cluster using FileZilla.
- The rsd file contains a seurat object which includes the raw count data and the cell type annotation data.
- This needs filtering, as we only want cells from unaffected ovaries and from pre-menopausal patients.
- It can be converted to a h5ad file using R and read into python.

### Dataset Filtering
- Patient information (age, menopausal status, and race) were extracted from S2 of [Supplementary Tables](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41588-022-01254-1/MediaObjects/41588_2022_1254_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx).
- Patient ids from unaffected ovary samples (this can be extracted from the main Seurat object): 6,14,15,18.
- We want to keep patient patients 14 and 15 as these are pre-menopausal.

### Number of Cells/Nuclei
22,219
