# Dataset GSE118127

### Paper
[Single-cell reconstruction of follicular remodeling in the human adult ovary](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11036-9)

### Code
[SingleCell](https://github.com/johnmous/singleCell)

### Cell types
- GC (five clusters),
- TC and stroma (five clusters), 
- smooth muscle cells (two clusters), 
- endothelial cells (three clusters), and 
- immune cells (four clusters)

### Data Format and Access
- Raw filtered counts (H5) can be downloaded from [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118127).
- Raw and processed data can also be downloaded from the [cellxgene](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/2902f08c-f83c-470e-a541-e463e25e5058) as RDS and H5AD.
- Cell-type annotations are provided in the RDS and H5AD files.
- The H5AD was downloaded; counts and metadata were extracted directly from this using scanpy in python.

### Dataset Filtering
- No filtering is needed. All samples are relevant. The object given has already been preprocessed and is ready to go.

### Number of Cells/Nuclei after filtering
20,676
