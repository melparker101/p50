OE
Theca/Stroma


### Data Format and Access
- Raw count data (cellranger filtered feature barcode files) are deposited on [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE192722).
- A [supplementary file](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42003-022-04384-8/MediaObjects/42003_2022_4384_MOESM2_ESM.pdf) is provided in the paper.
- Cell-type annotations were not provided - clustering and labelling needed doing manually using Seurat in R, following their R code and paper methods.
