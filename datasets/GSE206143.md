### Data Format and Access
- Raw data can be found on [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE206143).
- Download all of the barcode, matrix and features files - this can be made into a counts matrix in R and then into a Seurat object.
- Cell-type annotations were not provided - this was done manually with Seurat in R, following the author's github code and paper methods.

### Dataset Filtering
Donor ethnicity was unknown. Therefore all samples were used. No sample filtering required.

### Number of Cells/Nuclei after filtering
7,609
