### Data format and access

- Download [aux.seurat.shared.rsd](https://cedars.app.box.com/s/1ks3eyzlpnjbrseefw3j4k7nx6p2ut02). 
- This was done manually on windows and then transferred across to the cluster using FileZilla.
- The rsd file contains a seurat object which includes the raw count data and the cell type annotation data.
- This needs filtering, as we only want cells from unaffected ovaries 
- It can be converted to a h5ad file using R and read into python.
