# Clustering and cell type annotation
Clustering and cell type annotation was performed using Seurat, following the original author's methods. The replicates of cell-type clusters were similar, but not exactly the same, most likely due to the version of Seurat used. The clusters were annotated manually using the same marker genes used in the original studies as well as a visual comparison between UMAPs.
